Step 1: Create the Virtual Environment
Open your terminal in your project folder (C:\Users\harsh\...\Text Regeneration App) and run this command. This creates a new folder named venv that will contain a fresh copy of Python and its packages.

Bash

python -m venv venv
### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
You must activate the environment in your terminal each time you work on the project. Run this command:

Bash

.\venv\Scripts\Activate
You will know it worked because your terminal prompt will change to show (venv) at the beginning.
